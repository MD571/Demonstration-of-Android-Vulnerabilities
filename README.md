## About
   The project is a `Demonstration of Android Vulnerabilities` which is a `Kotlin-based` application.  The system provides a detailed demonstration of an Android attack through a vulnerability in Android. 
## Features
The system offers several attacks at first and allows you to select the level of security. Low security level exposes the vulnerable page of the corresponding attack, while high security level leads to a secure page devoid of any vulnerability to the selected attack.There are four types of attacks outlined in the system: 
* Broken Authentication
* Session Management
* Insecure Data Storage
* Database Attack
